# Curriculum Overview

The Artificial Intelligence Technology is now one of the most biggest technological paradigm of 21st Century.

But, to this date, the game industry is still using conventional, relatively safe game AI's which are based on controlled environment of individual games.

This curriculum is based on the infamous book of Julian Togelius and Georgios Yannakakis' book on game AI, the <<td>Artificial Intelligence and Games>.
