			<th>Overview</th>
			<td>This is a course in mathematical reasoning, with
emphasis on logic, set theory, number theory, and combinatorics.
Successful students will be able to read and understand mathematical
proofs, find errors in proofs, and construct their own proofs in these
disciplines. Students will also learn how to the spot errors in
arguments outside of mathematics. The course is targeted to students
in Mathematics, Mathematics Education, and Computer Science, although
other students with an interest in rigorous mathematical reasoning
will benefit. Evaluation of these objectives will be by tests and/or
quizzes.
