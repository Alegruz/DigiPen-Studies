			<th>Overview</th>
			<td>This course studies data abstraction, various data structures (arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.) and effcient algorithms on those data structures. Through this course, students can enlarge the knowledge of computer science and can improve their programming skills.</td>
		</tr>			
		<tr>
			<th>Objectives</th>
			<td>Study fundamental concepts of data structures such as array, list, stack, queue, tree, sort, and search. Understand how to implement the concepts through labs and homework. Obtain the least programming skills necessary for studying other courses of the computer engineering major and for industry practice.  </td>
