## DigiPen: MAT250 Linear Algebra
This course presents the mathematical foundations of linear algebra, which includes a review of basic matrix algebra and linear systems of equations as well as basics of linear transformations in Euclidean spaces, determinants, and the Gauss-Jordan Algorithm. The more substantial part of the course begins with abstract vector spaces and the study of linear independence and bases. Further topics may include orthogonality, change of basis, general theory of linear transformations, and eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Other topics may include applications to least-squares approximations and Fourier transforms, differential equations, and computer graphics.
