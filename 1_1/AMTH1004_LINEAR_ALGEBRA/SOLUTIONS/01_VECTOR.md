# 1.1 Vector Geometry and Algebra

## 14. Put points A, B, C, D, E, F as each vertex of a hexagon that has the Origin as its center. Express following vectors with a = OA and b = OB

* (a) AB
	* b - a
* (b) BC
	* -a
* (c) AD
	* -2a
* (d) CF
	* 2(a - b)
* (e) AC
	* b - 2a
* (f) BC+DE+FA
	* 0

### 20. Draw the coordinate of u and v and show the position of w
**u = (-2, 1), v = (2, -2), w = -u - 2v**
* w = (-2, 3)

### 22.Draw the standard position with u and v, then express w with linear combination of u and v
**u = (-2, 3), v = (2, 1), w = (2, 9)**
* w = 2u + 3v

### 26. u and v are binary vectors. What is u + v?
**u = (1, 1, 0), v = (1, 1, 1)**
* u + v = (0, 0, 1)

### 41. (2, 1, 2) + (2, 0, 1) in Zahlen 3 dimension 3 modulo space
* (1, 1, 0)
