## DigiPen: MAT225 Calculus and Analytic Geometry III
Prerequisite: MAT200<br>
This course extends the basic ideas of calculus to the context of functions of several variables and vector-valued functions. Topics include partial derivatives, tangent planes, and Lagrange multipliers. The study of curves in two- and three space focuses on curvature, torsion, and the TNB-frame. Topics in vector analysis include multiple integrals, vector fields, Green’s Theorem, the Divergence Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem. Additionally, the course may cover the basics of differential equations.
